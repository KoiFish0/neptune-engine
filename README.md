# Neptune 

> This engine is still under development and lacks significant features.

A minimal 3D game engine programmed and programmable in C++. 


## Prerequisites

To use this engine, it's recommended to have:
 - Basic C++ programming knowledge
 - Basic graphical programming knowledge

## Dependencies
 - git
     - Recommended tool to clone the repo
 - C/C++ Compiler (gcc, clang, etc.)
     - Needed to compile the code
 - CMake
     - An alternative method of compiling
    

## Getting Started

To use Neptune, you need to git clone this repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/KoiFish0/neptune-engine.git ./project-name
```

From here, you can put your code in the src/ directory. You can use the included main.cpp file as a sample file. Anything in the src/ directory contains a "game" developed using Neptune. It is used for testing the engine but can also be used a sample "game".

## Documentation

Currently, there is no proper documentation, however, the comments in my code should serve as adequate documentation of the engine in the mean time. 

> [!NOTE] 
> This engine has only been verified to work on Linux.
