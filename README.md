> This engine is still under development and lacks significant features. It is currently more of an abstraction layer than an engine.

A header-only low-level 3D game engine programmed and programmable in C++. No fancy gui or interface, just C/C++ and a text editor.

## Prerequisites

To use this engine, it's recommended to have these skills:
 - C++ Programming
 - Graphics Programming

## Dependencies
 - git (Optional)
     - Recommended to clone the repo
 - Open Asset Import Library (assimp)
     - Used for loading 3D Models

## Libraries used
 - GLFW (OpenGL wrapper) 
 - GLAD (OpenGL wrapper)
 - GLM (Math Library)

## Getting Started

To use Neptune, you need to clone this repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/KoiFish0/neptune-engine.git ./project-name
```

From here, you can put your code in the src/ directory. You can use the included main.cpp file as a sample file.

## Documentation

Documentation is available on the [wiki](https://github.com/KoiFish0/neptune-engine/wiki). The source code is also well commented if you want to see how the engine works.

> [!NOTE] 
> This engine has only been verified to work on Linux but should work on Windows and MacOS provided it is compiled for the corresponding OS
