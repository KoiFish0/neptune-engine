# Neptune 

A minimal 3D game engine programmed and programmable in C++. 

## Prerequisites

To use this engine, it's recommended to have:
 - Basic Computer Science Skills
 - Basic C++ Programming Skills
 - Graphical programming knowledge

## Getting Started

To use Neptune, you need to git clone this repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/KoiFish0/neptune-engine.git include/project-name
```

From here, you can put your code in main.cpp. There is already a relatively decent sample file in there already. Until a proper sample file and documentation is implemented, just use main.cpp. 
## Documentation

Currently, there is no proper documentation, however, the comments in my code should serve as adequate documentation of the engine. 

> **Note:** This engine has only been verified to work on Linux.
